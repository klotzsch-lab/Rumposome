# Rumposome

Program for Single Molecule Localisation Microscopy of Rumposome structure
Description
The program is an early stage version of a simulation, data exploration and analysis tool for single molecule localisation microscopy data. This version is working in our hands for analysis of our specific datasets with knowledge of its code and limitations. It is not yet suitable for general application. If a more polished version is available it will be linked here.

Requirements:
This program was written in Python version 3.10 with packages included in anaconda version 23.5.0 and was only run within PyCharm version 2022.2.2.
